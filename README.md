1. using mobile first approach for responsive design
2. Since every company has its own set of UI components and Icon library, the syntax are slightly different from each other, here I just use common html entity for those simple icons. They can be easily converted to customised UI libraries, such as fontAwesome/MaterialUI, etc...
3. Have some slight modification on the sample UI.
4. use 'rem' as units except borders
